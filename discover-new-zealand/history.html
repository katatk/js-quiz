                        <h2>The Treaty of Waitangi</h2>
                        <img src="img/treaty-of-waitangi.jpg" alt="The Treaty of Waitangi" class="float-right">
                        <p>British migrant settlers were arriving around the late 1830's en masse, there were large-scale land transactions with Māori, unruly behaviour by some settlers and signs that the French were interested in annexing New Zealand. The British government was initially unwilling to act, but it eventually realised that annexing the country could protect Māori, regulate British subjects and secure commercial interests.</p>
                        <p>On the 6th February, 1840 the Treaty of Waitangi was signed between the British Crown and 540 Māori rangatira (chiefs), bringing New Zealand into the British Empire and giving Māori "equal rights" with British citizens. The Treaty is a broad statement of principles on which the British and Māori made a political compact to found a nation state and build a government in New Zealand.</p>
                        <p>In the English version of the Treaty, Māori cede the sovereignty of New Zealand to Britain; Māori give the Crown an exclusive right to buy lands they wish to sell, and, in return, are guaranteed full rights of ownership of their lands, forests, fisheries and other possessions; and Māori are given the rights and privileges of British subjects.</p>
                        <p>The Treaty was sent around the country for the Māori chiefs to sign, although many were uncertain, others refused and some did not get the chance to sign. The Colonial Office in England later declared that the Treaty applied to Māori tribes whose chiefs had not signed. British sovereignty over the country was proclaimed on 21 May 1840.</p>
                        <p>There is controversy surrounding the Treaty, that the Māori translation does not reflect the same meaning as the English version and that the Crown did not uphold their end of the deal in regards to giving iwi full rights to their lands. The Treaty is not considered part of domestic law, but often it is referred to in the 'spirit' or intention of the Treaty.</p>
